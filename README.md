# tap-bigcommerce

[Singer](https://singer.io) tap for [BigCommerce](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/).

## Requirements
- python 3.6+

## Installation

In the directory:

```
$ mkvirtualenv -p python3 tap-bigcommerce
$ pip3 install -e .
```

## Usage

### Create config file

This config is to authenticate into BigCommerce. Legacy API credentials not accepted.

* Orders stream requires _read_ permission on Orders
* Customers stream requires _read_ permission on Customers
* Products stream requires _read_ permission on Products
* Coupons stream requires _read_ permission on Marketing

"start_date" is used for resources that can be filtered by date_modified - orders, customers and products

Coupons table is incremental but doesn't have a date_modified field, so id is used as replication key


```
{
  "client_id": "xxxxxxxxx",
  "access_token": "xxxxxxxxx",
  "store_hash": "xxxxxxxxx",
  "start_date": "2017-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

### Discovery mode

This command returns a JSON that describes the schema of each table.

```
$ tap-bigcommerce --config config.json --discover
```

To save this to `catalog.json`:

```
$ tap-bigcommerce --config config.json --discover > catalog.json
```

### Field selection

You can tell the tap to extract specific fields by editing `catalog.json` to make selections. By default all fields are selected. You can change metadata for specific fields or tables and change the "selected" field value to false.

```
"metadata": [
  {
    "breadcrumb": [],
    "metadata": {
      "table-key-properties": [
        "id"
      ],
      "forced-replication-method": "INCREMENTAL",
      "selected-by-default": true,
      "valid-replication-keys": [
        "date_modified"
      ]
    }
  },
  {
    "breadcrumb": [
      "properties",
      "id"
    ],
    "metadata": {
      "inclusion": "automatic",
      "selected": true
    }
  },
  ...
```

### Sync Mode

With an annotated `catalog.json`, the tap can be invoked in sync mode:

```
$ tap-bigcommerce --config config.json --catalog catalog.json
```

Messages are written to standard output following the Singer specification. The resultant stream of JSON data can be consumed by a Singer target.


## Replication Methods and State File

Use the following command to pipe tap into your Singer target of choice and update the state file in one go.

```
tap-bigcommerce --config config.json --catalog catalog.json --state state.json | target > state.json.tmp && tail -1 state.json.tmp > state.json
```
